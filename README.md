# TOP-Etch-a-Sketch 

This is a project from The Odin Project named "Project: Etch- a-Sketch"

I'll use this read me file as place to stored the Problem solving approach.

First let's defined the Pseudo Code

~A 16x16 must be created using divs as part of a JS function.
    For this part I'll do different div to have 16 rows with 16 squares. Using for loops.
~The previos divs should be inside a div called container.
~Use flex from CSS to make the grid (avoid usig CSS Grid).
~Double check size of squares when using borders or margins.

This should be the whole senario.
